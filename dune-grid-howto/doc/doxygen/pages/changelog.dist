/** \page ChangeLog Change Log
 *
 *  The change log lists the major steps taken between the different releases.
 *
 *  \section Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.10
 *  - Lagrange base functions have been fixed.
 *  .
 
 *  \section Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.9.2
 *  - Pass now has 3rd template argument passId, which is by default set to
 *    -1
 *  - in addition to new Pass, new CreatePass isn't compatible any more 
 *    with old passes. To plug a pass into new CreatePass one must use new Pass
 *  - in addition to new Pass, class Selector that is given to the class
 *    DiscreteModelCaller as a third template parameter, has to be wrapped 
 *    by CombinedSelector< ThisType , Selector >, and then the class
 *    DiscreteModelCaller must take this wrapper instead of the class Selector
 *  .
 
 *
 *  \section Changes from 0.9 to 0.9.1
 *  - The evaluation methods taking a Quadrature and an int as arguments are
 *    now mere fronts for the evaluate methods taking a PointType.
 *  - Local functions now use an \ref EngineConcept "engine concept".
 *  - The method scalarProductDofs in \ref Dune::DiscreteFunctionInterface
 *    "discrete functions" is now parallelized (do not communicate afterwards).
 *  - Communication managers now support different communication operations
 *    (i.e., copy, add, etc.) and different communication interfaces and
 *    directions. Communication of higher codims should also work.
