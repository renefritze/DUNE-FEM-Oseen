burriad's TODO list
-------------------
Caching:
- Add method on intersection iterator to identify non-conforming intersections
- Switch off caching on those intersections (only on unrefined sides)
- Enhance implementation so that it is able to deal with prisms and pyramids

Quadrature:
- in ElementQuadrature and CachingQuadrature: rename point -> globalPoint and localPoint -> point in order to adhere to the naming scheme of Quadrature
- make sure to change the method names in all other files as well!

DGPass:
- Remove assumption of orthonormal base functions by replacing vol by massMatrix
- Remove hard-coded quadrature order

Base functions:
- Add methods to efficiently calculate massMatrix and its inverse
- Make sure that you don't get name clashes with the classes in dune/fem/common
