 *  On this page, suggestions to improve dune-fem are collected. So feel free
 *  to add any suggestions or comment on them...
 *
 *  \section before10 ... that Should Be Implemented Before 1.0
 *
 *  - Revisit quadratures (either implement a quadrature interface using
 *    the Barton-Nackman trick or implement an engine concept). Both would
 *    allow the operator[] to be default implemented.
 *  - Have a stack of discrete functions (which might be cleared on adaption
 *    and limited to hold only a small number of discrete functions)
 *  - Write a ConstLocalFunction class
 *  - Write class hierarchy 
 *    FunctionSpace -> GridFunctionSpace -> DiscreteFunctionSpace
 *    Function -> GridFunction -> DiscreteFunction
 *    (GridFunction has a ConstLocalFunction method but no localfunction)
 *  - base everything in dune-fem on GridParts (e.g. EntityType from
 *    GridPart...)
 *  - Allow the use of different floating point types (especially of higher
 *    precision than double). Maybe implement a Float< precision > class that
 *    gives a default implementation for the desired precision.
 *    Also, the concept should be checked to allow for complex numbers (at
 *    least as RangeFieldType).
 *  - more documentation for I/O
 *  - Extend <fem/misc/eoc> and make errors stored in FieldVector possible.
 *  - Unify the naming and parameter ordering of axpy operations. Maybe the
 *    best choice is to use the following:
 *    \code
 *    ThisType &axpy ( const FieldType &a, const ThisType &x );
 *    \endcode
 *    This is the way its done in FieldVector.

 *  \section after10 ... that Should Be Implemented After 1.0
 *
 *  \section brainstorm ... that Might Be of Interest
 *
 *  - Make LocalFunctionStorages singleton
 *  - Add a LocalFunctionSpace to discrete function spaces. This way, some
 *    specializations need not be done in the local function. The local
 *    function space should at least provide the following features:
 *    - the base function set
 *    - the entity
 *    - a method mapToGlobal
 *    .
 *    Then, the localFunction method on the discrete function can be called
 *    with the local function space. Therefore, the base function set and the
 *    Dof mappings need only be fetched once (the caching part could even be
 *    done in a wrapper).
 *  - Have method for stiffness and mass matrix on basefunctionsets.
 *  - DG method for non orthonormal basefunctionsets
 *  - Continuous Galerkin for order > 3 and mixed finite element spaces
 *    (proof concept...)
 *  - write evaluate on localfunctions as matrix matrix multiplication 
 *  - DGspace with gemeralized Lagrangebasefunctionsets (Gauss-Labatto)
 *  - Revisit operator concept
 *  - A GridPart with all classes wrapped (i.e. Entities, Geometry...)
 *  - IndexSets build using GridPart
 *  - Improved DG Limiter Pass
 *  - Compact LDG Operator 
 *  - Clarify which jacobian method operates on the reference element and which one
 *    on real elements.
 *  - Implement a quadrature that reads its points from an ASCII file. This way,
 *    we do not need a quadrature for every floating point type.
 *  - Description of norms/metrics and default implementation of error functionals
 *    induced by norms/metrics.
