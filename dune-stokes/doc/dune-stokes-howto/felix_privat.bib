  title = {Computational Methods for Multiphase Flows in Porous Media},
  publisher = {Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia},

  author = {Z. Chen and G. Huan and Y. Ma},
  abstract = {Mathematical models of petroleum reservoirs have been utilized since
	the late 1800s (Darcy, 1856). A mathematical model consists of a
	set of differential equations that describe the flow of fluids in
	the petroleum reservoirs, together with an appropriate set of boundary
	and/or initial conditions. The reliability of predictions from a
	reservoir model depends on how well the model describes a field.
	To develop a model, in general simplifying assumptions need be made
	because the field is too complicated to be described exactly. The
	assumptions needed to solve a model analytically are verx restrictive;
	many analytical solutions require that the reservoir be homogeneous
	and isotropic, for example. It is usually necessary to solve a mathematical
	model approximately using numerical methods. Since the 1950s, when
	digital computers became widely available, numerical models have
	been used to predict, understand, and optimize complex physical fluid
	flow processes in petroleum reservoirs. Moreover, the emergence of
	complex enhanced recovery techniques in the field of oil production
	has emphasized the need for sophisticated mathematical and computational
	tools, capable of modeling intricate physical phenomena and sharply
	changing fluid interfaces. The objective ofthis book is to provide
	researchers in the area of porous media flow, especially in petroleum
	reservoirs, with an overview of various multiphase flow and transport
	models and the current, state-of-the-art computational methods used
	in the solution of these models.
	
	This book offers a fundamental and practical introduction to the use
	of computational methods, particularly finite element methods, in
	the simulation of fluid flow in petroleum reservoirs. In the presentation,
	we have attempted to introduce every concept in the simplest possible
	setting and to maintain a level of treatment that is as rigorous
	as possible without being unnecessarily abstract. In developing numerical
	methods, a brief discussion of the basic concepts has been given
	in the text as needed, and the reader is referred to appropriate
	references for more details. We have not attempted to give any mathematical
	proofs, but rather we review multiphase flow equations and computational
	methods to introduce the basic terminologies and notation. We have
	attempted to present a thorough discussion of practical aspects of
	these subjects in a consistent manner, and to focus on the mathematical
	formulations of these equations and on applications of the computational
	methods to their solution.
	
	This book covers four major topics (flow and transport differential
	equations and their numerical solutions, rock and fluid properties,
	numerical methods, and linear system solvers), eight applications
	(single phase flow, two-phase flow, flow ofblack oil type, volatile
	oil flow, compositional flow, nonisothermal flow, chemical compositional
	flow, and flows in fractured porous media), and six special topics
	(welling modeling, upscaling, history matching, parallel computing,
	oil recovery optimization, and surface network systems). Each chapter
	ends with bibliographical information and exercises.
	
	In Chapter 2, after an introduction in Section 2.1, we review the
	basic governing equations for single phase flow (Section 2.2), two-phase
	flow (Section 2.3), transport of a component in a fluid phase (Section
	2.4), transport of multicomponents in a fluid phase (Section 2.5),
	flow of black oil type (Section 2.6), flow of volatile oil type (Section
	2.7), compositional flow (Section 2.8), nonisothermal flow (Section
	2.9), chemical compositional flow (Section 2.10), and flows in fractured
	porous media (Section 2.11). As an example, deformable media, non-Darcy's
	law, and other effects are discussed for single phase flow in Section
	2.2. Also, alternative differential equations are developed for two-phase
	flow in Section 2.3; these alternative formulations can be extend~d
	to flows of other types. Relationships among all these flows are
	mentioned in Section 2.12.
	
	In Chapter 3, we consider rock and fluid properties. In particular,
	capillary pressures and relative permeabilities are discussed for
	the rock properties in Section 3.1, and oil, gas, and water properties
	and equations of state are studied for the fluid properties in Section
	3.2. In Section 3.3, temperature-dependent rock and fluid properties
	are described.
	
	In Chapter 4, numerical methods are developed; an emphasis is placed
	on the development of finite element methods. After an introduction
	to the classical finite difference methods in Section 4.1, six major
	types offinite element methods are reviewed: standard (Section 4.2),
	control volume (Section 4.3), discontinuous (Section 4.4), mixed
	(Section 4.5), characteristic (Section 4.6), and adaptive (Section
	4.7). All these finite element methods have been employed in petroleum
	reservoir simulation. For each method, a brief introduction, the
	notation, basic tenninology, and necessary concepts are given.
	
	In Chapter 5, solution techniques for solving the linear systems arising
	in numerical reservoir simulation are considered; both direct and
	iterative algorithms are introduced. In Sections 5.1 and 5.2, we
	discuss Gaussian elimination or Cholesky's method for tridiagonal
	and general banded matrices, respectively. Because the structure
	of a matrix depends on the ordering of nodes, Section 5.3 is devoted
	to this topic. Then Krylov subspace algorithms are described: conjugate
	gradient (CG), generalized minimum residual (GMRES), orthogonal minimum
	residual (ORTHOMIN), and biconjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGSTAB)
	iterative algorithms, respectively, in Sections 5.4-5.7. Preconditioned
	versions of these algorithms and the choice of preconditioners are
	studied in Sections 5.8 and 5.9. Practical considerations for the
	choice of preconditioners in reservoir simulation are given in Section
	5.10. Finally, comparisons of direct and iterative algorithms are
	presented in Section 5.11.
	
	In Chapters 6-12, numerical and computational methods for single phase
	flow, twophase flow, flow of black oil type, compositional flow,
	nonisothermal flow, chemical compositional flow, and flows in fractured
	porous media respectively, are studied. For single and two-phase
	flows, numerical and analytic solutions are compared. For two-phase
	flow, a comparison between different numerical methods is also presented.
	For the flow of black oil type, different solution schemes (e.g.,
	fully implicit, sequential, and IMPES-implicit in pressure and explicit
	in saturation) are assessed. The numerical and experimental examples
	given in Chapters 6-12 are based on the benchmark problems of the
	first nine comparative solution projects organized by the society
	of petroleum engineers and real field data analysis.
	
	In Chapter 13, vertical and horizontal well modeling using finite
	difference and finite element methods is discussed. Finally, in Chapter
	14 special topics on upscaling, history matching, parallel computing,
	oil recovery optimization, and surface network systems are briefly
	touched on.},

@BOOK{CD99,
  title = {An Introduction to Homogenization},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press Inc., New York},
  year = {1999},
  author = {D. Cioranescu and P. Donato},
  abstract = {The aim of homogenization theory is to establish the macroscopic behaviour
	of a system which is 'microscopically' heterogeneous, in order to
	describe some characteristics of the heterogeneous medium (for instance,
	its thermal or electrical conductivity). This means that the heterogeneous
	material is replaced by a homogeneous fictitious one (the 'homogenized'
	material), whose global (or overall) characteristics are a good approximation
	of the initial ones. From the mathematical point of view, this signifies
	mainly that the solutions of a boundary value problem, depending
	on a small parameter, converge to the solution of a limit boundary
	value problem which is explicitly described.
	
	During the last ten years, we have both had the opportunity to give
	courses on homogenization theory for graduate and postgraduate students
	in several universities and schools of engineers. We realized that,
	while at the research level many excellent books have been written
	in the past, for the graduate level there was a lack of elementary
	reference books which could be used as an introduction to the field.
	Also, many classical and known results in linear homogenization,
	though currently taught, are not really available in the literature,
	either in books or in research articles. This lack naturally led
	to the idea to extend the material of our courses into the book we
	present here.
	
	When teaching, we had to take into account that often the audience
	was not really familiar with the variational approach of partial
	differential equations (PDEs), which is the natural framework for
	homogenization theory. This is why we started the book with this
	topic. It is the subject of the first four chapters.
	
	We have deliberately chosen not to present too many results, but to
	have those included all well explained. We focus our attention on
	the periodic homogenization of linear partial differential equations.
	A periodic distribution of the heterogeneities is a realistic assumption
	for a large class of applications. From the mathematical point of
	view, it contains the main difficulties arising in the study of composite
	materials.
	
	Chapter 1 deals with two notions of convergence, the weak and the
	weak* one. This allows us to describe, in Chapter 2, the asymptotic
	behaviour of rapidly oscillating periodic functions.
	
	In Chapter 3 we introduce the distributions and give the basic notions
	and theorems of Sobolev spaces. We pay particular attention to Sobolev
	spaces of periodic functions. The results of this chapter, as well
	as those of Chapter 1, are classical and are the necessary prerequisites
	for the variational approach of PDEs. We do not give their proofs
	but detailed references are quoted.
	
	In Chapter 4 the variational approach to classical second order linear
	elliptic equations is introduced. Existence and uniqueness results
	for solutions of these equations with various boundary conditions
	are proved. Again we treat in detail the case of periodic boundary
	conditions.
	
	From Chapter 5 to Chapter 12 we treat the periodic homogenization
	of several kinds of second order boundary value problems with rapidly
	oscillating periodic coefficients. We are concerned with elliptic
	equations, the linearized system of elasticity, the heat and the
	wave equations.
	
	The model case is the Dirichlet problem for elliptic equations. The
	results concerning this case are the object of Chapters 5 and 6.
	In Chapter 5 we formulate the problem and list some physical examples.
	We also study two particular cases: the one-dimensional case and
	the case of layered materials. In Chapter 6 we state the general
	homogenization result and prove some properties of the homogenized
	coefficients.
	
	The main homogenization methods for proving the general result are
	presented in Chapters 7-9. Thus, the multiple-scale method is described
	in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 is devoted to the oscillating test functions
	method. Finally, in Chapter 9 we introduce the two-scale convergence
	method.
	
	In Chapter 8 we also prove some important related results, as for
	instance the convergence of energies and the existence of correctors.
	The convergence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is also proved.
	
	Chapters 10, 11 and 12 are devoted to the linearized system of elasticity,
	the heat equation and the wave equations respectively. In each chapter,
	we start by proving the existence and uniqueness of a solution. Then,
	we study the homogenization of the problem.
	
	We conclude this book with a short overview of some general approaches
	to the study of the non-periodic case.},

@BOOK{Whi99,
  title = {The Method of Volume Averaging},
  publisher = {Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht},
  year = {1999},
  author = {S. Whitaker},
  abstract = {This monograph is based on a graduate course that has been taught
	at UC Davis since 1976, and the subjects have been selected primarily
	for their pedagogical value. Most of the material can be covered
	in 28 one-hour lectures; however, shorter versions of a course can
	be developed by omitting several sections that are especially time
	consuming or by omitting one or more of the five chapters. The problems
	at the end of each chapter represent an integral part of the monograph
	and the solutions are available from the author.
	
	Chapter 1 deals with bulk diffusion and heterogeneous reaction in
	porous media, and it serves to present the key elements of the method
	of volume averaging. In an abbreviated treatment, one can omit Sec.
	1.1 and begin with Sec. 1.2 where the boundary value problem for
	diffusion and reaction is analyzed. Section 1.2 is crucial to all
	that follows. The origins of many of the length-scale constraints
	that appear in the method of volume averaging are discussed in Sec.
	1.3. If one is willing to accept those constraints without proof,
	this section can be omitted. The closure problem that is developed
	in Sec. 104 is also crucial to all that follows, while the material
	on symmetric unit cells that is presented in Sec. 1.5 can be accepted
	without proof if one is inclined to do so. Section 1.6 deals with
	the comparison between theory and experiment and this is an essential
	part of Chapter 1.
	
	Chapter 2 represents a study of transient heat conduction in two-phas,e
	systems, and one of the dominant concepts in this chapter is the
	principle of local thermal equilibrium. All multiphase transport
	processes should be considered both in terms of a theory for the
	separate dependent variables associated with each phase, and in terms
	of a single dependent variable that might accurately describe the
	multiphase transport process. Section 2.3 deals with this specific
	problem.
	
	Chapter 3 has a single objective which is to examine the phenomena
	of spatial dispersion. Since both spatial and temporal dispersion
	occur in many processes of interest to engineers, it is important
	to clearly identify the physics associated with spatial dispersion
	and this is best done in a study of passive dispersion. Here the
	word passive refers to the absence of adsorption, heterogeneous reaction,
	and interphase mass transport. These phenomena are of great importance
	to many engineers and scientists, and dispersion in active systems
	is examined in several of the problems at the end of the chapter.
	
	Chapter 4 is devoted to the derivation of Darcy's law. This result
	is the key to understanding a wide variety of processes involving
	flow in porous media, and it also serves as an excellent example
	of the role of the closure problem in the determination of the final
	form of the volume averaged transport equation.
	
	Chapter 5 represents a study of single-phase flow in heterogeneous
	porous media. Since most real systems are heterogeneous at some scale
	of interest, it is this last short chapter that provides a theoretical
	foundation for many important problems of transport in porous media.},

  pages = {3-25},
  abstract = {Stokes flow through a rigid porous medium is analyzed in terms of
	the method of volume averaging. The traditional averaging procedure
	leads to an equation of motion and a continuity equation expressed
	in terms of the volume-averaged pressure and velocity. The equation
	of motion contains integrals involving spatial deviations of the
	pressure and velocity, the Brinkman correction, and other lower-order
	terms. The analysis clearly indicates why the Brinkman correction
	should not be used to accommodate a no slip condition at an interface
	between a porous medium and a bounding solid surface.
	
	The presence of spatial deviations of the pressure and velocity in
	the volume-averaged equations of motion gives rise to a closure problem,
	and representations for the spatial deviations are derived that lead
	to Darcy's law. The theoretical development is not restricted to
	either homogeneous or spatially periodic porous media; however, the
	problem of abrupt changes in the structure of a porous medium is
	not considered.},
