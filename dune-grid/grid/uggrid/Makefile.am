# tricks like undefAllMacros.pl don't have to be shipped, have they?
# Oliver Sander: It depends. undefAllMacros.pl creates the file ug_undefs.hh
# which contains an #undef line for each macro encountered in the UG
# headers which DUNE includes.  This should be redone every time UG
# changes, and currently I do it and then check in the new ug_undefs.hh.
# An alternative would be to have the DUNE-build system call undefAllMacros
# for the UG it is configured with.  Then it needed to be shipped.
